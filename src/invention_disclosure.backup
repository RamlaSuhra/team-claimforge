Invention Title: AI-Powered Predictive Water Management System for Smart Homes

Description:
The invention is a smart home system designed to prevent water damage by proactively identifying potential leaks. The system uses a network of wireless, self-adhesive acoustic sensors placed on water pipes throughout a home. These sensors continuously listen for the unique acoustic signatures of dripping or pipe stress that precede a major leak.

The data from the sensors is streamed to a central hub in the home. This hub contains a machine learning model (AI) that has been trained to distinguish between normal water flow sounds and anomalous acoustic patterns indicative of a potential failure.

When the AI detects a high-risk pattern, it triggers several actions:
1. It sends an alert to the homeowner's smartphone application, specifying the location of the potential leak.
2. It can be configured to automatically shut off the main water supply via an electronically controlled valve to prevent catastrophic damage.
3. The system logs all acoustic data, allowing for trend analysis and predictive maintenance scheduling.

The novelty lies in the combination of real-time acoustic analysis with a predictive AI model to preemptively act before a leak becomes a significant event, unlike existing systems that only detect the presence of water after a leak has already occurred.
